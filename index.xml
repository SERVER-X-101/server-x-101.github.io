      <description>The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2 as composite (not prime). After iterating through all numbers up to the square root of the limit, the remaining unmarked numbers are primes.&#xA;Python Implementation file_type_python&#xD;sieve_of_eratosthenes.py def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit): primes = [True] * (limit + 1) primes[0] = primes[1] = False p = 2 while p * p &amp;lt;= limit: # If primes[p] is not changed, then it is a prime if primes[p]: # Update all multiples of p starting from p^2 for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p): primes[i] = False p += 1 prime_numbers = [] for i in range(2, limit + 1): if primes[i]: prime_numbers.</description>

      <description>A directed graph exhibits strong connectivity when every pair of vertices is connected by a path. A strongly connected component (SCC) within such a graph is a largest subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. For instance, in the given graph, there are three SCCs.&#xA;Algorithm:&#xA;Tarjan&amp;rsquo;s algorithm utilizes DFS (Depth First Search) traversal. It maintains three arrays: disc[] to store discovery time of vertices, low[] to store the earliest visited vertex reachable from subtree rooted with current vertex, and stackMember[] to keep track of vertices present in the stack.</description>
